# cars-config

A wrapper around the Cars.com Config API.

Config will be downloaded from a URL given by the environment variable CONFIG_API.
If CONFIG_API is not set, the URL will default to 'http://composite-ft.cars.com/config-api/1.0/rest/config'.

For local development, you can override properties from the Config API by creating a file named "env.json" in the working directory of this project.
(You can either do this in the www-cars-com-rendering/node_modules folder, or you can clone this repo and use "npm link".)

If you want to work offline, set CONFIG_API to a local URL.
